# Image-Classification-by-Tensorflow
Image Classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow. Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training. Developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This repository contains implementation for multiclass image classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow. These two codes have no interdependecy on each other. 

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
To be updated soon.

## Modules Required
You can download the modules in the respective requirements.txt for each implementation.


### Implementation using Tensorflow
os<br>
time<br>
cv2<br>

## Steps
1. Install the modules required based on the type of implementation.
2. Download the dataset you want to train and predict your system with. For sample data, you can download the [tenserflow_dataset].
3. Construct the folder sub-structure required.
